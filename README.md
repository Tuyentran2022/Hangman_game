# TODO1: Create an empty list called "display". For each letter in chosen_word, add a "_" to "display". If the chosen word was apple, display should be ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_"].
# TODO2: Loop through each position in the chosen_word. If the letter at the position matches "guess" then reveal that letter in the "display" at that position.
# TODO3: Print this "display" and we can see the guessed letter replace with "_"
